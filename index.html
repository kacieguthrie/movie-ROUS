        <h2>About the Film</h2>
        <p>Hard headed Louisiana fisherman Thomas Gonzales doesn't know what will
          hit him next. After decades of hurricanes and oil spills he faces a new
          threat - hordes of monstrous 20 pound swamp rats. Known as "nutria", these
          invasive South American rodents breed faster than the roving squads of
          hunters can control them. And with their orange teeth and voracious appetite
          they are eating up the coastal wetlands that protects Thomas and his town of
          Delacroix Island from hurricanes. But the people who have lived here for
          generations are not the type of folks who will give up without a fight.
          Thomas and a pack of lively bounty hunters are hellbent on saving Louisiana
           before it dissolves beneath their feet. It is man vs. rodent. May the best
           mammal win.</p>

        <h2>The Filmmakers</h2>
        <p>Award winning non-fiction filmmakers Quinn Costello, Chris Metzler and
          Jeff Springer have traveled to many corners of the world in search of
          unique stories highlighting the important environmental, scientific and
          cultural issues of contemporary society. With the success of documentary
          projects as varied as PLAGUES & PLEASURES ON THE SALTON SEA, THE NEW
          ENVIRONMENTALISTS and EVERYDAY SUNSHINE: THE STORY OF FISHBONE they have
          gone on to screen their work at SXSW and Tribeca along with national TV
          broadcasts on PBS and the Sundance Channel. Along the way they have
          continued to pursue other sub-cultural documentary subjects, including:
          rogue economists, lucha libre wrestlers, ganja-preneurs and evangelical
          Christian surfers.</p>
        <p>
          The filmmakers of RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE grew up in different parts of the
          country, but a passion for the swamp sealed their pact.  Cajun Reeboks were
          donned and the journey began in search of the notorious "nutria rat".
          Four years after first setting sail for Louisiana they emerged from the bayou
          covered in mosquito bites and an unwavering love for a place at the "End of the
          World" that is bursting with joy.</p>
